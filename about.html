								<h3>What does a session look like?</h3>
								<p>Every session is designed to be highly effective, supportive, and completely focused on your child's success. We move beyond simple content review to build deep, conceptual mastery. Our approach is summarised by our five key principles:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Personalised & Diagnostic:</b> We begin with a brief diagnostic to identify your child's specific knowledge gaps and common misconceptions. Sessions are then entirely bespoke, with a customised learning path and tailored resources prepared just for them.</li>
									<li><b>Expertly Curated Resources:</b> You will benefit from a wealth of high-quality, pre-prepared resources that support deep conceptual understanding, active recall, and rigorous exam preparation, ensuring all materials are perfectly aligned with the learning objective.</li>
									<li><b>Research-Informed Teaching:</b> Our methods are driven by advanced educational research. We use active, responsive teaching techniques to address misconceptions immediately and ensure your child isn't just memorising, but truly understanding the material.</li>
									<li><b>Confidence & Independence:</b> We create a warm, supportive learning environment that helps your child feel confident, motivated, and genuinely engaged in their subjects. Integrated alongside academic content, we teach the study habits and reflective skills that empower students to understand how they learn best. This combination builds real confidence now and long‑term independence for future academic success.</li>
									<li><b>Structured Progress:</b> Progress is measured through continuous in-session assessment, application to targeted exam-style questions, and, optionally, targeted homework designed to enforce active recall. You will see measurable steps toward achieving your academic goals.</li>
